This is a toy implementation of a parser for level files for the game
"Digimon World 2".  Credit goes to Remy_rm and nDoorn for figuring out
a lot of the format details as well as providing useful documentation
about the format from previous folks working on it.

More information can be found in the [crate documentation][dox].
